AI-Enhanced News Backend System
Developed a robust backend system that delivers intelligent news article retrieval and enrichment. The system supports multiple endpoints—/category, /source, /score, /nearby, and /search—to organize and serve news from a preloaded database. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to:

Interpret user queries and extract intent (e.g., topic, location, source preference)

Retrieve and rank relevant articles based on extracted intent and user proximity

Enrich articles with AI-generated summaries, key entities, and metadata

The system outputs clean, structured JSON responses, providing users with titles, sources, locations, and LLM-enhanced content for a more insightful and personalized news experience.
